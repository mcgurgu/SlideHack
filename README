SlideHack - Slideshare Document Downloader
========================

Copyright(c) 2012, Ronan Mouchoux (@yenos, <rmouchoux a gmail dot com>)

Origin
===============
Some slideshare's documents are not available for downloading. I wanted to download and print one of them and 
spend a few hours to find a way to get it.

Install / Usage
===============
The app work with python and standart library.

Usage is described when typing the -h or --help option:

> ./python slidehack.py -h
usage: slidehack.py [-h] -f FILENAME -u URL

SlideHack is a tool to download (I hope) most of SlideShare documents
unavailable to download and save it into a PDF file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILENAME, --filename FILENAME
                        Your output pdf filename (ex : foobar.pdf)
  -u URL, --url URL     The presentation URL (ex : http://http://www.slideshar
                        e.net/guest66dc5f/rahulanalysisofadversarialcode)

Version History
===============

Version 1 - Actual version. Will probably evolve.

Feedback
=============

I'm programming just for fun, so if you notice in the SlideHack's code unoptimized
algorithms or odds things: just tell me! 
In the future, I would like to allow getting SlideShare's documents avalaible for downloading 
through SlideHack. But it's clearly not a priority
